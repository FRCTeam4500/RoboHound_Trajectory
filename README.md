# RoboHound Trajectory
RoboHound Trajectory is 4500's custom motion profiling API. It was heavily inspired by [Jacis' Pathfinder](https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder), [254's Cheesy Path](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2018-Public/tree/master/cheesy-path), and [Endoman's Pathplanner](https://github.com/Endoman123/pathplanner) (which is based off of Vannakas).

# Directories 
* **src/application** contains all of the code for the GUI (which uses JavaFX)
* **src/robohound_trajectory** contains the code for generating a path

# TODO
* Generate a seperate path for each module
* Write code for the PIDVA + Gyro loop.
